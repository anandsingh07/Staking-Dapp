# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```
Run Hardhat node:
```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Next, you need to deploy the staking contract. You have two options:
Option 1 - Using Ignition:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Staking.js --network localhost
```
Option 2 â€“ Using the `deploy.js` script:
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

After deployment, you need to update the contract address in your frontend. In `staking-frontend/src/App.js`, the current address is:
```javascript
const contractAddress = "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3";
```
You need to replace it with the new address you get after deployment.

To verify that everything is correct:
1. Make sure the Hardhat node is running:
    ```shell
    npx hardhat node
    ```
2. Deploy the contract using one of the options mentioned above.
3. Copy the address of the deployed contract and update contractAddress in your frontend.
4. Restart your React app.
